In light of the unprecedented challenges posed by COVID-19, there was an urgent need to delve into available data to gain insights that can inform public health responses and mitigation strategies. With this imperative in mind, this exploratory data project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 deaths from a global perspective. By scrutinizing trends and patterns in COVID-19 mortality data, I aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing the severity of the pandemic and identify regions or demographics that may be particularly vulnerable.

For this project, I sourced data for COVID-19 deaths from "https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths" which is openly available.

Methodology:

To accomplish this objective, I employed SQL as the primary tool for data exploration and analysis. SQL offers a robust framework for querying and manipulating large datasets efficiently, making it Ill-suited for extracting insights from the extensive repositories of COVID-19 data available. Leveraging SQL, I conducted a comprehensive examination of COVID-19 death statistics, encompassing variables such as geographical location, time period, demographic characteristics, and vaccinations.

Furthermore, I utilized the insights gleaned from the SQL analysis to develop a dynamic visualization dashboard using Tableau. This dashboard serves as a visual representation of the trends identified in the data, allowing for intuitive comparisons of COVID-19 deaths and infection rates across different countries and regions. By integrating SQL-generated insights into the Tableau dashboard, I aimed to provide both researchers and those looking for answers with a user-friendly interface for exploring and interpreting COVID-19 mortality data.

In summary, this exploratory data project combines the analytical power of SQL with the visualization capabilities of Tableau to shed light on the multifaceted dynamics of COVID-19 deaths worldwide. Through rigorous data exploration and visualization, I aim to contribute valuable insights that can inform both the public and private sectors for more efficient resource allocation strategies.
